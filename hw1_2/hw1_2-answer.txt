If we scale this adder up to a very large number of bits, the timing delay from Cin on the first adder (Fulladder 0) to Cout on the last adder (Fulladder N) will increase. This means sequential logic blocks which are waiting on the output of the large adder to be ready will have to wait a longer time. This is all because each single bit adder must execute and pass its output (Cout) to the next adders input (Cin).
